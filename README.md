## Self-Reflection:
This was a little confusing to do. I have some understanding of github but a lot I still don't know. The coding part was fine since I know HTML and CSS. This was my first time using Visual Studio code. Last time I was using html for web design I was using Netbeans. But overall, It was okay. I need to figure out github a litlle bit more but i'll be doing that overtime during this course.

### How long it took me to finish this?
It took me 5 hours to complete this project.
